# buffons-needle-drop-experiment
Constructed as demonstrator for Pi Day 2017, this
is a Monte Carlo simulation of Buffon's Needle Drop
Experiment.

## Use
1. First choose the number of grid lines you want on the board and
choose Set Lines.
1. Then enter a line size as a ratio of the distance between grid lines.
For example, if you enter .8 you are selecting a size 80% of grid line width.
1. Enter the number of needles you wish to drop, and the time between each
drop (in ms).
1. Press the "Run Sim" button.

The estimation calculation at the bottom should hover around Pi.
